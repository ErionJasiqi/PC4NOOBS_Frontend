        <h1>Power Supply</h1>

        <p>
            The power supply unit provides power to all components of your PC and should therefore be chosen with care. It affects not only the stability but also the efficiency and longevity of the entire system.

            The most important factors are the power output in watts, the efficiency class (e.g., 80 Plus Bronze, Gold, or higher), and compatibility with the case and motherboard. The required wattage depends on the CPU, graphics card, and other hardware; a modern gaming PC usually requires 550 to 750 watts. You should also make sure that there are sufficient and suitable connections. High-quality power supplies offer quiet operation, protective circuits, and often modular cable management, which facilitates installation and ensures better airflow.
