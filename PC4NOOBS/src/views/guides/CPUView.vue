            You should select a CPU that is compatible with your motherboard, as both must be compatible with each other. Performance, price, intended use, power consumption, and cooling play an important role in your selection. Depending on your intended use, whether gaming, creative work, or simple office applications, you can decide which processor is the best choice for your system.
