        <h1>Graphics Card</h1>

        <p>
            For everyday tasks such as word processing, spreadsheets, or surfing the web, the graphics integrated into the processor are usually sufficient. However, if you want to play games or use demanding creative and professional programs, you will need a dedicated graphics card with its own GPU. The choice depends primarily on whether you play games, what monitor resolution you use, and how high your budget is. If you use integrated graphics, you should also make sure that your motherboard has the appropriate image outputs.
