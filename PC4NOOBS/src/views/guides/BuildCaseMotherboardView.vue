             First, you should check that all spacers are correctly positioned for your motherboard model. These small raised sections prevent the circuit board from resting directly on the metal and protect against short circuits.

            Now carefully place the motherboard into the case, align the connectors on the I/O panel at the rear, and check that all screw holes are aligned with the spacers. Screw the board in place evenly and carefully—tightening too much can damage the circuit board.

            Make sure that no cables or case parts are in the way before you finally tighten the screws. Now you can connect the other components.
