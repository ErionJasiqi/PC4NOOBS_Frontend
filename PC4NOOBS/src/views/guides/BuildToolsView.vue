            Although a simple screwdriver is often sufficient for assembling a PC, a small tool kit is a sensible investment. Not only does it make assembly easier, it is also useful for later upgrades or other repairs.

            Since many different screws are used during assembly, a magnetic storage tray or a small sorting box helps to keep track of them. Glass side panels from cases should be stored safely after removal, preferably in their original packaging. It is also advisable to have a tidy, well-lit workspace with sufficient space. Food and drinks should be kept away to avoid damage to the components.
