            Case fans ensure good airflow and keep the temperatures of all components within a safe range. A balanced combination of intake and exhaust fans improves cooling performance and reduces noise. It is important that the size and number of fans are suitable for the case and compatible with the motherboard.

            RGB lighting is optional and purely visual, but it gives your PC a unique look. Many fans and components offer addressable RGB that can be controlled via the motherboard or separate controllers. Make sure that RGB standards and connections are compatible with each other so that lighting and effects can be synchronized without any problems.
