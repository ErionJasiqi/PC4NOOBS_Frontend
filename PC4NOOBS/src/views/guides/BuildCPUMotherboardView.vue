        <p>
            Place the motherboard on a soft surface. Work calmly and with concentration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Take special care with the CPU, as the pins can bend very easily. Open the retaining lever on the socket and remove the protective cover. Pay attention to the small arrow on the socket and on the CPU, which shows the correct orientation. Insert the processor into the socket without applying pressure—it should fit by itself. If you encounter resistance, the alignment is incorrect.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the CPU is correctly seated, remove the plastic cover from the retaining frame. Important: Never use force, as this can permanently damage the motherboard or processor.
