            There are many options for mass storage, but for new systems, an M.2 SSD with PCI Express connectivity is the best choice. These compact drives save space, avoid cable clutter, and offer very high speeds, with PCIe 4.0 SSDs currently setting the performance standard.

            Traditional hard drives are still cheaper per gigabyte, but are usually unnecessary. An SSD is perfectly adequate for up to around 2 TB of storage. If you need very large amounts of data, 8 TB or more, conventional hard drives make more sense, as large SSDs are expensive and usually limited to 4 TB.
