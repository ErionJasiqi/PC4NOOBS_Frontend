            Next, we'll take care of the RAM.

            Take a close look at the DDR4 modules: there is a notch on the contacts that only fits into the slots on the motherboard in one direction. Check the manual beforehand to find out the optimal slot assignment for your number of modules. Insert the modules parallel to the board and press evenly on both ends until they audibly click into place and the levers lock.
        </p>

            DDR5 RAM is installed in the same way, except that the notch is in a different position so that DDR4 and DDR5 modules cannot be mixed up. Again, refer to the manual and check that the modules are securely seated after insertion.
