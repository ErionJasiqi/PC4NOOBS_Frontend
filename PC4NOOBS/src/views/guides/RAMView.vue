        <p>
            Depending on your CPU and motherboard, you will need DDR4 or DDR5 RAM. Pay attention to the maximum memory speeds supported by the motherboard and choose a suitable RAM kit, especially for performance-oriented builds.

            The amount of RAM you need depends on the intended use and your budget. 8 GB is considered the minimum today, but 16 GB or 32 GB is much more recommended. For most systems, you should use two identical modules for dual-channel operation. Mixing different brands or speeds is not advisable. High-end platforms can also support four or more modules.
